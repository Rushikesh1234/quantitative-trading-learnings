# Quantitative Trading Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey to becoming a quantitative developer. It includes learning content, code, and projects on **high-performance trading with C++**, **financial data APIs**, and **Python for quantitative finance**, with a focus on algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.

## C++ for High-Performance Trading

- **Introduction to C++ Programming**: Basics of C++, data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
- **C++ Syntax and Structure**: Writing, compiling, and debugging C++ programs; understanding basic program structure.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**:
  - **Containers**: Vectors, maps, sets, and more.
  - **Iterators**: Traversing through containers.
  - **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and modifying data.
  - **String and Stream Handling**: Efficient manipulation of text and input/output operations.
- **Memory Management in C++**:
  - Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `new` and `delete`.
  - Memory pools and custom allocators for performance optimization.
- **Low Latency Operations**:
  - Inline functions for faster execution.
  - Avoiding unnecessary memory copies using references.
- **Multithreading for Concurrency**:
  - Using `std::thread` for concurrent processing.
  - Thread synchronization using mutexes (`std::mutex`).
- **Low-Latency Systems in Trading**:
  - Efficient data structures: Circular buffers and lock-free queues.
  - Cache optimization through memory alignment and reducing system calls.

## Python for Quantitative Finance

- **Python for Data Analysis**:
  - Data manipulation and analysis with `pandas` and `numpy`.
  - Working with time series data and financial data processing.
- **Financial Data APIs and Market Data Feeds**:
  - Fetching financial data from APIs like **Alpha Vantage**, **Yahoo Finance**, and real-time WebSocket feeds.
  - Handling and processing real-time market data feeds.
- **Python for Trading Strategies**:
  - Implementing backtesting frameworks for evaluating trading strategies.
  - Using financial libraries like **QuantLib** for derivative pricing and risk management.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Plotting financial data, trends, and price movements using **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**.
  - Visualizing moving averages, stock prices, and other financial indicators.
- **Real-Time Alerts and Monitoring**:
  - Implementing real-time alert systems for price thresholds and trading signals.
  - Integrating with live data streams to trigger automated actions.

## Additional Topics

- **C++ for High-Performance Trading**:
  - Understanding the need for low-latency execution in trading algorithms.
  - Optimizing C++ code for speed, memory efficiency, and reliability.
- **Real-Time Trading Systems**:
  - Building real-time data processing pipelines.
  - Handling order execution, risk management, and trade execution strategies.

## Goal

The ultimate goal is to leverage the knowledge gained in both **C++** and **Python** to implement efficient, low-latency trading strategies in real-time environments. By combining high-performance execution in C++ with data analysis and strategy implementation in Python, I aim to design algorithms capable of making trading decisions at high speed and with minimal risk.

This is an ongoing learning journey, and more topics and projects will be added as I continue exploring quantitative trading techniques. The repository will evolve with new content and improvements to reflect progress in quantitative finance and algorithmic trading.
