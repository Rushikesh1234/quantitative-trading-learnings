# Quantitative Trading Learning Journey

This repository documents my 15-day learning path to becoming a quantitative developer. It includes code and projects focusing on high-performance trading with C++, financial data APIs, and Python for quantitative finance. The emphasis is on algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.

## **QuantTrade Engine - High-Performance Strategy Simulator**
- This project is a comprehensive quantitative trading engine designed for backtesting and executing trading strategies. It leverages C++ for low-latency processing and Python for data fetching, visualization, and backtesting.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Building low-latency systems for real-time data processing, order execution, and risk management.
- **Execution Engine**: Simulating trades, managing positions, and handling order matching with optimized execution logic.

**Code**: [QuantTradeEngine](./QuantTradeEngine)

## **C++ for High-Performance Trading**
- **Introduction to C++**: Basics, syntax, control structures, and OOP principles (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Containers (vectors, maps, sets), iterators, and algorithms for efficient data manipulation.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, performance optimization through custom allocators.
- **Low Latency Operations**: Optimizing speed with inline functions, reference passing, and multithreading using `std::thread` for concurrent processing.

**Code**: [Practice_C++ Folder](./Practice_C++)

## **Python for Quantitative Finance**
- **Data Analysis**: Manipulating and analyzing financial data using pandas and numpy.
- **Financial Data APIs**: Fetching market data from APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, and handling real-time feeds.
- **Trading Strategies & Backtesting**: Implementing backtesting frameworks for trading strategies and using libraries like QuantLib for derivative pricing.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting trends and financial indicators with Matplotlib and Plotly.

**Code**: [Practice_Python.ipynb](./Practice_Python.ipynb)

## **Goal**
The first goal is to learn and understnad, how all Quantitative Trading things works. Then another goal is to integrate C++ for low-latency execution and Python for strategy development and analysis. This allows for creating high-performance trading algorithms capable of making decisions at high speeds and with minimal risk.
